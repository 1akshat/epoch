# Epoch - The Fastly Charting Library
By Ryan Sandor Richards

## Using Epoch

To use epoch to perform charting in your project, do the following:

1. Place the versioned `epoch.X.Y.Z.min.js` file in your project and load it in your page.
2. Place the `css/epoch.css` in your project and include it in a link reference.


## Developing Epoch

To work on the epoch charting library itself do the following:

1. Clone the repository
2. Install the npm package `node-minify`; `npm install -g node-minify`, then `npm link node-minify`. 
2.2 `npm install -g codo` - Documentation (CLEAN ME UP)
3. Run `cake build` from the project directory
4. View `docs/static.html` and `docs/time.html` for a quick overview of the available features
5. Scour the source for more detailed information (formal documentation coming soon)
6. Let cool and enjoy (serves millions).
