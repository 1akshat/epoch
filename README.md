# Epoch - The Fastly Charting Library
By Ryan Sandor Richards

## Using Epoch

To use epoch to perform charting in your project, do the following:

1. Place the versioned `epoch.X.Y.Z.min.js` file in your project and load it in your page.
2. Place the `css/epoch.css` in your project and include it in a link reference.


## Developing Epoch

To work on the epoch charting library itself do the following:

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `cake build` from the project directory
3. View `docs/static.html` and `docs/time.html` for a quick overview of the available features
4. Scour the source for more detailed information (formal documentation coming soon)
5. Copy the `epoch.x.y.z.min.js` file into your project's static assets folder
6. Let cool and enjoy (serves millions).
